# Git-task3
Third practical task to course "Version Control with Git" 


1. Create a storm branch and add a commit to the storm.txt file: Twenty ships with Norsemen braves Riding the northern wind
2. Add 2 more lines to storm.txt and make another commit: They left their shores at early dawn As a red sun was rising in the east
3. Return to master and create the pursuit.txt file with the text below: The warming sun returns again And melts away the snow The sea is freed from icy chains Winter is letting go. Make a commit.
4. Mark the commit with session1 tag and go to the storm branch.
5. Rebase the storm branch so that it contains the last commit from the master.
